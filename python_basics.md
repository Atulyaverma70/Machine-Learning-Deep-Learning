## lambda function
    * lambda function are anonymous function.
### difference between lambda function and anonymous function
* lambda has no return value
* lambda func is written in one line
* lambda func not used for code reusability
* lambda func has no name

### why used lambda function
* used along with higher order function(function that need one more fuction to perform)

## matplotlib
    * data visualization library

* scatter plot
    * used when you want to compare two quantities

* heatmap
    * it tells the relations between the variables which one is important
    * converting the grid into the graph

## Seaborn
    * it provides a layer of abstraction hence simple to use
    * better asthetic
    * more graph include
* Seaborn has different different plots
    1. Relational 
        * scatter, line plots
    2. Distribution(tell the distribution of data)
        * histogram
        * kdeplot
        * regplot
    3. categorical
        * Barplot
        * countplot
        * boxplot
        * viloin plot
        * swarmplot
    4. matrix
        * heatmap
        * cluster map
    5. regplot
    6. multiplots
        * jointplot
        * pairplot
