* In which scenarion Decision Tree are more useful then Random forest?
    - Explainbility
    - Computation power
    - feature is important

* what you do when you are handling with imbalanced dataset?
    - Resampling
    - give priority to minority class
    - use different metrics for accuracy

*  Why we have logistic regression instead of logistic calssification?
    - because in that we get the range of value like if sigmoid fuction is .56 it means that the probability for becoming one and .44 for becoming zero.

*  what is OOB(out of Bag) error and how it is useful?(it comes generally in bagging and random forest)?
    - like when we perform bagging we randomly select the feture and those fetures are not selected any time that are used for OOB evaluation

* what is Naive in Naive Bayes?
    -  refers to the assumption that all features are independent of each other, which is often unrealistic but simplifies computation.

* what is semisupervised learning?
    - it is partially supervised and partially unsupervised
    -  uses a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data to train a model

* when the median is more effective then mean?
    - both are used to find central tendency of data(center of data)
    - when the data set has outliar then use median
    - when there is no outliar then use mean
      
* what is the difference between Bagging and boosting?
    - bagging are genrally used when we have low bias(means perform well in training data) and high variance (didnt perform well when change in data)
    - boosting is used in High bias and low variance.
    - in bagging model train parallel and in boosting model train sequentially

* what the difference between structured and unstructured data?
    - structured data is that store in tabular form and and unstructured data is like that when we want to store comments of any post 
    - structured data is in text form and unstructured data in any like sound,image, text

* when we use Deep learning over Machine learning?
    - deep learning is used when the 
        - performance matter(like in health care sector)
        - complex data

* when we didnt use deep learning?
    - data is less
    - cost(hardware)x
    - iterpretbility

* lazy learning algorithm and eager learning algorithm?
    -  lazy learner algo is that which do not learn during training phase(learn in pridiction phase) and eager learning is that do learn in training phase
    - lazy learners store the training data and eager do not
    - in lazy learner training is fast and prediction is slow
    - in eager learning training is slow and predition is fast.

* difference between parametric and non-parametric  ML algorithm?
    -  when we make the assumption of nature of function that kind of algo is parametric.(Linear regression).
    - when we dont make any assumption of function then it is non parametric algo(decision tree)
    
* what is the dofference between variance and conditional variance.
    * Variance and Conditional Variance are statistical concepts used to measure the spread or dispersion of a random variable
    - Variance measures the average squared deviation of a random variable from its mean. It indicates how much the values of the variable differ from the expected value (mean).
    - Conditional variance measures the variance of a random variable 

* What is the normal distribution and standard normal distribution?
    * Normal distribution is a bell-shaped curve representing data symmetrically distributed around a mean  with standard deviation .
    * Standard normal distribution is a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.
