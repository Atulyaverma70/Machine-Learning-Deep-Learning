# Pytorch
* It is used for tensor based calculation.
* Open source deep learning library: developed by Meta AI
* PyTorch is an open-source deep learning framework developed by Facebook's AI Research (FAIR) lab. It is widely used for machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence applications, particularly in research and production.
* Key Features of PyTorch:
    * Dynamic Computation Graphs – Unlike TensorFlow (which initially used static graphs), PyTorch allows dynamic computation graphs, making it more flexible and easier to debug.
    * Autograd (Automatic Differentiation) – PyTorch provides automatic differentiation using torch.autograd, simplifying backpropagation for neural networks.
    * Tensor Computations – PyTorch provides a NumPy-like torch.Tensor with GPU acceleration support.
    * GPU Acceleration – PyTorch can seamlessly move tensors and models to GPUs using CUDA.
    * TorchScript – Enables converting PyTorch models into a deployable format for production.
    * Rich Ecosystem – Supports libraries like torchvision (for computer vision), torchaudio (for audio processing), and torchtext (for NLP).
    * Community & Industry Adoption – Used by major companies and research institutions for deep learning applications.
